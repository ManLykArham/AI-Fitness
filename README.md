# 🤖 AI Fitness - Sequel to Calorie Counter Web App

## 🚀 Project Overview and Learning Outcomes

**AI Fitness** is the sequel to my **Calorie Counter Web App** with numerous exciting improvements! This app leverages **NextJS**, **TypeScript**, and **Tailwind CSS** to create a modern, user-friendly fitness tracking application. A standout feature is the AI chatbot, which is integrated with **OpenAI's Assistant API** and is trained on user-specific data, such as their weekly eating habits and workout routines. This allows the chatbot to deliver personalised fitness and nutrition advice based on users’ real activities.

### Current Status Update:

> Currently, the API I was using for food-related data (such as calories and serving size) has transitioned out of free use. As a result, while I am still retrieving most micronutrient data, some key information (like calorie count and serving size) is not currently available. I am actively working on finding a suitable alternative or building a workaround to restore full functionality.

The app also introduces a **meal creation** section, where users can build and track their meals, and a more intuitive design that makes navigating the app smoother. Additionally, there's a **dashboard** with a **pie chart** that visually tracks the user's fitness progress.

## ✨ Key Features

- **AI Chatbot** 🤖: Integrated with **OpenAI's Assistant API**, the chatbot analyses user data from the past week, including meals and workout routines, to provide personalised fitness and nutrition advice.
- **Intuitive Design** 🎨: The UI, built using **Tailwind CSS**, is modern and easy to navigate, ensuring a smooth user experience.
- **Meal Creation and Tracking** 🍽️: Users can create their own meals, track them, and receive feedback on their nutrition based on their activity.
- **Password Strength Check** 🔐: During registration, the app ensures strong password creation, requiring a mix of lowercase, uppercase, numeric, and special characters.
- **Dashboard** 📊: Visualise your progress with an easy-to-understand pie chart on the dashboard.
- **Profile Management** 🛠️: Users can update their fitness goals, profile details, and passwords directly from the app’s settings.

## 🛠️ How to Use

1. **Sign Up and Log In**: Users can register with a secure password, then input their weight, height, and fitness goals to get started.
   
2. **Track Exercise and Calories Burned**: The exercise tab allows users to log workouts and track calories burned based on time and activity type.

3. **Log Meals and Calories Gained**: Users can input their meals and see how many calories they've gained based on the food type and quantity (Note: currently, calorie data may not be available due to the API transition).

4. **Create Your Own Meals**: In the “Own Meal” section, users can create and log their custom meals, including nutritional details, for easy tracking.

5. **AI Chatbot Interaction**: Ask the chatbot for fitness or nutrition advice, and it will offer tailored suggestions based on your workout and eating patterns from the past week, using the **OpenAI Assistant API**.

6. **Update Profile**: Adjust your fitness goals, change your password, or update your weight and height in the **Settings** section.

## 🏆 Achievements

Building **AI Fitness** gave me the opportunity to further develop my **full-stack skills**. Working with **NextJS** and **TypeScript** allowed me to optimise the app for performance and scalability, while **Tailwind CSS** made designing an intuitive interface much faster and more efficient. 

The integration with **OpenAI's Assistant API** was a key learning point, as I worked on passing user-specific data (meals and workouts) to provide personalised advice. Additionally, the improvements in the UI and security (strong password requirements) made the app feel more polished and professional.

## 🎯 Overall

**AI Fitness** is a major step up from my previous projects. It combines the power of modern web frameworks with AI to deliver a personalised fitness experience. I’m particularly proud of how the chatbot evolved to offer tailored advice, and how the app's design improved. Going forward, I plan to enhance code efficiency and implement **SSG (Static Site Generation)** to make the app even faster and more responsive.

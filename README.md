# 🤖 AI Fitness - Sequel to Calorie Counter Web App

## 🚀 Project Overview and Learning Outcomes

**AI Fitness** is the sequel to my **Calorie Counter Web App** with numerous exciting improvements! This app leverages **NextJS**, **TypeScript**, and **Tailwind CSS** to create a modern, user-friendly fitness tracking application. A standout feature is the AI chatbot, which is integrated with **OpenAI's Assistant API** and is trained on user-specific data, such as their weekly eating habits and workout routines. This allows the chatbot to deliver personalized fitness and nutrition advice based on users’ real activities.

The app also introduces a **meal creation** section, where users can build and track their meals, and a more intuitive design that makes navigating the app smoother. Additionally, there's a **dashboard** with a **pie chart** that visually tracks the user's fitness progress.

## 🏆 Achievements

Building **AI Fitness** gave me the opportunity to further develop my **full-stack skills**. Working with **NextJS** and **TypeScript** allowed me to optimize the app for performance and scalability, while **Tailwind CSS** made designing an intuitive interface much faster and more efficient. 

The integration with **OpenAI's Assistant API** was a key learning point, as I worked on passing user-specific data (meals and workouts) to provide personalized advice. Additionally, the improvements in the UI and security (strong password requirements) made the app feel more polished and professional.

## 🎯 Overall

**AI Fitness** is a major step up from my previous projects. It combines the power of modern web frameworks with AI to deliver a personalized fitness experience. I’m particularly proud of how the chatbot evolved to offer tailored advice, and how the app's design improved. Going forward, I plan to enhance code efficiency and implement **SSG (Static Site Generation)** to make the app even faster and more responsive.
